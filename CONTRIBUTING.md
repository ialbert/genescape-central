Whether you're fixing a bug as quietly as snow falling on cedars, or adding a feature as boldly as a prairie sunrise, remember: 

1. be well, for kindness nurtures both code and coder; 
2. do good work, for craftsmanship echoes in eternity; 
3. and keep in touch, for in the sharing of updates, issues, and pull requests, we find the strength of our community. 

As the seasons roll from spring commits to autumn releases, let us walk this path together, creating software that, like a good story, enriches all who encounter it.
